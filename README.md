## What this is
This repo contains a presentation and teaching materials for learning how to use the Raspberry Pi with various sensors.

The materials were originally for a hackathon in Arizona. I stripped out most of the localized stuff so that this can be used for generalized education.

`hardware_presentation` has a short presentation (mostly photos) introducing key concepts about the Raspberry Pi and electronics in general.

`projects` contains hands-on projects that can be built and run following the instructions. They include:
  - Blinking a LED
  - Using a motion detector
  - Recording temperature and humidity

`scripts` contains helper scripts to build a Raspberry Pi operating system using a piece of software called the [PiBakery](http://www.pibakery.org/). These scripts aren't necessary for following the instructions, but it will install a lot of software that makes working with the Pi easier.
